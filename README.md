Solidity plugin for asdf version manager

## Install

`asdf plugin-add solidity https://github.com/smartcontractkit/asdf-solidity.git`

## Requirements

Linux users don't need to install any dependencies. In Linux the solidity installation  consists of a statically linked `solc` executable.

For macOS, you need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. The rest of the dependencies will be automatically installed through Homebrew. Please refer to the [Solidity Installation Guide](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html).
